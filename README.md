### 👋 About Me

💬 I'm Laura, also known as **N0gales**.  
🔐 I began in the field of physical security, but after completing the **Professional Certificate in Information Security (Unitel)**, I transitioned into cybersecurity with a strong focus on technical depth and structured analysis.

🧠 I am currently developing skills in:

- Security automation with Python  
- Log analysis and stateful detection modeling  
- System behavior analysis  
- Blue Team & Detection Engineering concepts  

My approach focuses on understanding how systems behave internally and how security logic can be modeled programmatically.
